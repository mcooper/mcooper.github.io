However, in some parts of the world, mortality rates remain stubbornly high. Furthermore, rising temperatures and increasingly extreme precipitation caused by climate change will affect crop production, food security, sanitation infrastructure, and disease vectors, ultimately increased risk of future child mortality in vulnerable areas. Given these twin processes – increasing levels of development as well as an increasingly extreme climate - great uncertainties remain about potential futures for global child mortality.\nTo better understand how the risk of child mortality varies with extremes in climate, we draw on a vast dataset of 6.5 million children from 59 developing countries, with each child matched to local climatic, economic, and social variables over the course of their lives. We find that various indicators of development are associated with lower mortality risk, while climate extremes are associated with higher mortality risk. We further find that the types of climate extremes most associated with mortality are strongly dependant on the duration of the shock, with both short-term rainfall excesses and long-term rainfall deficits associated with a greater risk of mortality.\nFinally, to assess how future trajectories of development, demographic change, and climate change could affect child mortality risk, we draw on five different scenarios of the future from Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) coupled with bias-corrected climate models from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP). We fit a model based on our historic dataset of child mortality and use it to predict potential future rates based on these scenarios. We show what the various scenarios could mean for child mortality outcomes and highlight the regions of the world potentially most vulnerable to climate shocks.\n","date":1568419200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568419200,"objectID":"bba38511294eba09f7a1bd92dfdad02a","permalink":"https://mcooper.github.io/project/mortality/","publishdate":"2019-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mortality/","section":"project","summary":"What do different scenarios of the 21st century mean for child mortality?","tags":null,"title":"Scenarios of Child Mortality","type":"project"},{"authors":["Matthew Cooper","Molly Brown","Stefan Hochrainer-Stigler","Georg Pflug","Ian McCallum","Steffen Fritz","Julie Silva","Alex Zvoleff"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566864000,"objectID":"667fb931ae1246f8022a5992246c14ae","permalink":"https://mcooper.github.io/publication/spei-malnutrition/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/spei-malnutrition/","section":"publication","summary":"We use geolocated child nutrition data from 53 developing countries to show that minor to severe droughts as well as severe periods of extreme rainfall are related to child stunting.

However, the linkages between the duration and severity of precipitation shocks and their effects on child nutrition and household food security metrics remain underexplored. In this study, we used Feed the Future datasets from Ghana and Bangladesh to examine the impact of precipitation extremes on nutrition, measured by children’s height-for-age and weight-for-height Z-scores, and food security, measured by the Household Hunger Scale. We used a spatial error regression to control for the effects of spatial autocorrelation, and we found an association between precipitation shocks and household hunger in both Ghana and Bangladesh, as well as an association between higher rainfall and worse child nutrition in Ghana.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Hunger, nutrition, and precipitation: evidence from Ghana and Bangladesh","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Cooper","Enrico Di Minin","Anna Hausmann","Siyu Qin","Aaron Schwartz","Ricardo Aleixo Correia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"b80e17535c277b0af40d9e43e3339350","permalink":"https://mcooper.github.io/publication/aichi1/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aichi1/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to the importance of public support in fostering positive outcomes for biodiversity, Aichi Biodiversity Target 1 aims to increase public awareness of the value of biodiversity and actions that help to conserve it. However, indicators for this critical target have historically relied on public-opinion surveys that are time-consuming, geographically restricted, and expensive. Here, we present an alternative approach based on tracking the use of biodiversity-related keywords in 31 different languages in online newspapers, social media, and internet searches to monitor Aichi Target 1 in real-time, at a global scale, and at relatively low cost. By implementing the indicator, we show global patterns associated with spatio-temporal variability in public engagement with biodiversity topics, such as a clear drop in conversations around weekends and biodiversity-related topic congruence across culturally similar countries. Highly divergent scores across platforms for each country highlight the importance of sourcing information from multiple data streams. The data behind this global indicator is visualized and publicly available at BiodiversityEngagementIndicator.com and can be used by countries party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to report on their progress towards meeting Aichi Target 1 to the Secretariat. Continued and expanded monitoring using this indicator will provide further insights for better targeting of public awareness campaigns.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Developing a global indicator for Aichi Target 1 by merging online data sources to measure biodiversity awareness and engagement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Cooper","Alex Zvoleff","Mariano Gonzalez-Roglich","Felly Tusiime","Mark Musumba","Monica Noon","Peter Alele","Madeleine Nyiratuza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"d3f2e54a6e9891f0b49c1f4b28c437fc","permalink":"https://mcooper.github.io/publication/vs/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vs/","section":"publication","summary":"Wild foods and other nonfood NTFPs are important for improving food security and supplementing incomes in rural peoples' livelihoods. However, studies on the importance of NTFPs to rural communities are often limited to a few select sites and are conducted in areas that are already known to have high rates of NTFP use. To address this, we examined the role of geographic and household level variables in determining whether a household would report collecting wild foods and other nonfood NTFP across 25 agro-ecological landscapes in Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Ghana. The aim of this study was to contribute to the literature on NTFP collection in Africa and to better understand where people depend on these resources by drawing on a broad range of sites that were highly variable in geographic characteristics as well as rates of NTFP collection to provide a better understanding of the determinants of NTFP collection. We found that geographic factors, such as the presence of forests, non-forest natural areas like grasslands and shrublands, and lower population density significantly predict whether a household will report collecting NTFP, and that these factors have greater explanatory power than household characteristics.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Geographic factors predict wild food and nonfood NTFP collection by households across four African countries","type":"publication"}]
