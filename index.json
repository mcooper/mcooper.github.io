However, these studies typically use data reported at the city or county level, and, to date, have found no difference in vulnerability based on income or race.  We therefore use expressed mood in a quarter of a billion geolocated tweets as a proxy for mental health status available at fine spatial and temporal scales, and find stark differences in the effects of heat depending on neighborhood characteristics. Here we show that increased temperatures worsen expressed mood in all areas, but that this effect is much stronger in poor and Black neighborhoods. We also find that the effect of heat on expressed mood is greatest in the early morning, supporting the hypothesis that heat affects mental health through a sleep quality pathway. This paper presents the first evidence of neighborhood heterogeneity in the vulnerability of mental health to heat.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Fine-scale Data Reveals Neighborhood Inequalities In Effects of Heat on Expressed Mood","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625097600,"objectID":"00f4c071b310e329077f0240aae0b90c","permalink":"https://mcooper.github.io/project/mal-brazil/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mal-brazil/","section":"project","summary":"Using recurrent neural networks to anticipate future malaria outbreaks in Brazil","tags":null,"title":"Determinants of Malaria Outbreaks in Brazil","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Over the previous few decades, globally rising levels of wealth, maternal education, and sanitation have led to an unprecedented reduction in child mortality, particularly in middle-income countries. However, in some parts of the world, mortality rates remain stubbornly high. Furthermore, rising temperatures and increasingly extreme precipitation caused by climate change will affect crop production, food security, sanitation infrastructure, and disease vectors, ultimately increased risk of future child mortality in vulnerable areas. Given these twin processes ‚Äì increasing levels of development as well as an increasingly extreme climate - great uncertainties remain about potential futures for global child mortality.\nTo better understand how the risk of child mortality varies with extremes in climate, we draw on a vast dataset of 6.5 million children from 59 developing countries, with each child matched to local climatic, economic, and social variables over the course of their lives. We find that various indicators of development are associated with lower mortality risk, while climate extremes are associated with higher mortality risk. We further find that the types of climate extremes most associated with mortality are strongly dependant on the duration of the shock, with both short-term rainfall excesses and long-term rainfall deficits associated with a greater risk of mortality.\nFinally, to assess how future trajectories of development, demographic change, and climate change could affect child mortality risk, we draw on five different scenarios of the future from Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) coupled with bias-corrected climate models from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP). We fit a model based on our historic dataset of child mortality and use it to predict potential future rates based on these scenarios. We show what the various scenarios could mean for child mortality outcomes and highlight the regions of the world potentially most vulnerable to climate shocks.\n","date":1623628800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623628800,"objectID":"bba38511294eba09f7a1bd92dfdad02a","permalink":"https://mcooper.github.io/project/mortality/","publishdate":"2021-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mortality/","section":"project","summary":"What do different scenarios of the 21st century mean for child mortality?","tags":null,"title":"Scenarios of Child Mortality","type":"project"},{"authors":["","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

However, indicators for this critical target have historically relied on public-opinion surveys that are time-consuming, geographically restricted, and expensive. Here, we present an alternative approach based on tracking the use of biodiversity-related keywords in 31 different languages in online newspapers, social media, and internet searches to monitor Aichi Target 1 in real-time, at a global scale, and at relatively low cost. By implementing the indicator, we show global patterns associated with spatio-temporal variability in public engagement with biodiversity topics, such as a clear drop in conversations around weekends and biodiversity-related topic congruence across culturally similar countries. Highly divergent scores across platforms for each country highlight the importance of sourcing information from multiple data streams. The data behind this global indicator is visualized and publicly available at BiodiversityEngagementIndicator.com and can be used by countries party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to report on their progress towards meeting Aichi Target 1 to the Secretariat. Continued and expanded monitoring using this indicator will provide further insights for better targeting of public awareness campaigns.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Developing a global indicator for Aichi Target 1 by merging online data sources to measure biodiversity awareness and engagement","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://mcooper.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
